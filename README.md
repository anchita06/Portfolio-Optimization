## 📖 Introduction

### Three Core Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Modern Portfolio Theory** | Risk is inherent to higher rewards. MPT enables investors to maximize expected returns by quantifying and managing market risk through optimal asset allocation. |
| **Strategic Diversification** | Selecting a mix of assets with low or negative correlation to minimize overall portfolio volatility. |
| **Sharpe Ratio Optimization** | Measures excess return per unit of risk. Our methodology maximizes this ratio to ensure every unit of risk is justified. |
